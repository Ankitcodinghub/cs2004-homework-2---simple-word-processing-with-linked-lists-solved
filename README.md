Your program should be a robust one such that you have to consider all relevant programmer mistakes and extreme cases; you are expected to take actions accordingly!

Introduction

In this homework, you are asked to implement a simple word processor that will read two words from two different files and store them in two linked lists character by character. Your program will also process these lists by reading certain commands such as for inserting, deleting characters and finding the level of similarity between two words. After each command, some outputs regarding the operation will be displayed. The program details will be explained in the subsequent sections.

The Data Structure to be used

In this homework, you must use linked list (regular one-way linked list) as your main data structure. The node struct of this list must have the following data members (if you want, you can add constructors to the struct).

struct node

{

char ch; node * next;

};

Figure 1. The minimal data members that the node should have

In this struct, ch stores one character of a word, and next pointer points to the next node in the linked list.

You are not allowed to use arrays, vectors or any similar containers (including files) in this homework; all data must be stored and processed within the linked list structure.

Moreover, you are not allowed to use string to store the data that you will read from the files; strings can only be used to read the file names and the commands/arguments from the keyboard.

The input data will be given to the program using text files. A screenshot of a sample input file named in1.txt and the final structure of the linked list after reading the letters from this file are shown in

A screenshot of a sample input file named in1.txt and the final structure of the linked list after reading the letters from this file are shown in Figure 3.

Reading the Files and Creating the Linked Lists

Your program will start by asking the user to enter two file names, one by one. For each of these files, first you should check if it is opened successfully or not. If not opened, you have to read another file name.

Then, your program should read the contents of these two files and store each file‚Äôs content in a separate linked list character by character as described above.

Each file has one word, which is lined up vertically and each line has only one character. This is an assumption and you do not have to make an input check for this. We also assume that:

‚Ä¢ The file does not contain empty lines or whitespaces.

‚Ä¢ The file contains only lowercase English letters (i.e., from a to z).

These are the assumptions and you do not need to make an input check for the content of the files (but there will be some input checks for the commands and arguments as detailed below).

In order to store the contents of two files, you need to have two different linked lists with different head pointers. For each of the files, you will read file‚Äôs content line by line (i.e. letter by letter) and append each letter read to the end of the corresponding linked list. After that, your linked lists become ready to be processed with some commands as described below.

Operations/Commands to be Performed on the Linked Lists

After reading the data from the two files and storing them in two linked lists, first, you have to display the contents of the lists one by one. After that, your program will keep asking the user to enter a command followed by its arguments, if any. Basically, these commands are for inserting and deleting characters from the linked lists, finding similarity between two lists, and for exiting the program. Insertion and deletion commands also indicate the linked list number that this operation will be performed on (i.e., whether it is the linked list 1 or the linked list 2). Thus, we have a total of six commands that your program should support: del1, del2, insert1, insert2, sim, and exit.

‚Ä¢ del1 and del2 commands are followed by one argument, which is the letter to be deleted from the corresponding list. This command will delete all of the nodes that contain the given letter in the argument from the specified linked list. For example, if the list contains l l a m a and if the argument is l, then the list will contain a m a. As another example, if another list contains g o o g l e, and if the argument was g then the list will contain o o l e.

If the letter to be deleted does not exist in the list, then nothing will be deleted and a message that explains this has to be displayed. You have to display an output about the operation details and the content of the list after deletion. Please see the sample runs for example outputs. Other details about deletion are as follows.

o del1 will apply the deletion operation on the linked list 1. o del2 will apply the deletion operation on the linked list 2.

o The command and argument are separated by at least one whitespace and the argument is only one character. These are assumptions and you do not need to make input check for those.

o The argument should be a lowercase letter and you have to do an input check for this.

‚Ä¢ insert1 and insert2 commands are followed by two arguments, which have to be lowercase English letters. The first argument indicates the letter to be inserted after the first occurrence (just after first occurrence, not after all of the occurrences) of a node that contains the letter specified as the second argument. If the linked list does not contain a node with the second argument, then the program should insert the node that contains the first argument to the beginning of the linked list (i.e., it will become the head node). For example, if the list contains a l b a l a and if the arguments are t and l, then after insertion the list will contain a l t b a l a. As another example, suppose you insert once again to this updated list with arguments b and s; the list will contain

b a l t b a l a after insertion; here we inserted b to the beginning since there was no s. You have to display an output about the operation details and the content of the list after insertion.

Please see the sample runs for example outputs. Other details about insertion are as follows.

o insert1 will apply the insertion operation on linked list 1. o insert2 will apply the insertion operation on linked list 2.

o The command and the arguments are separated by at least one whitespace and each argument is only one character. These are assumptions and you do not need to make input check for those.

o The arguments should be lowercase letters and you have to do input check for this.

‚Ä¢ exit command indicates that the program will end. At this point, the program will stop asking the user for more commands and clear both of the lists by properly deleting all the memory allocated for them.

If the user enters an invalid command and/or invalid argument(s), your program should give an error message and continue by reading new commands and arguments.

You have to ignore all of the extra characters that might appear after an invalid command in the input line so that the next command is read fresh. You can do so by using the command cin.ignore(numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max(),‚Äô ‚Äò);

CAUTION

Walk-through Example

A walk-through run of the program is shown in Table 1. The example given in the table assumes that data from in1.txt and in2.txt have been successfully read and stored in two different linked lists.

Table 1 A walk-through example

Command Argum

ents (if any) Effect on the corresponding linked list Explanation

sim sim command will display the similarity value (2 in this case) and the contents of the linked lists without changing them.

del1 h Deleting all occurrences of letter ‚Äòh‚Äô from linked list 1

insert1 k m Inserting a node with letter ‚Äòk‚Äô after the node with letter ‚Äòm‚Äô in linked list 1

insert1 k f Inserting a node with letter ‚Äòk‚Äô at the beginning (i.e., to the head) of the linked list because no node with

letter ‚Äòf‚Äô exists in linked list 1

insert2 h e Inserting a node with letter ‚Äòh‚Äô after the node with letter ‚Äòe‚Äô in linked list 2

insert2 m h Inserting a node with letter ‚Äòm‚Äô after the first occurrence of a node with letter ‚Äòh‚Äô

sim sim command will

display the similarity value (0 in this case) and the contents of the linked lists without changing them.

exit The program will stop asking for further commands and will delete the two lists and terminate.

Some Important Rules

In order to get a full credit, your programs must be efficient and well presented, presence of any redundant computation or unnecessary memory usage or bad indentation, or missing, irrelevant comments are going to decrease your grades. You also have to use understandable identifier names, informative introduction and prompts. Modularity is also important; you have to use functions wherever needed and appropriate.

Please do not use any non-ASCII characters (Turkish or other) in your code.

/* Begin: code taken from ptrfunc.cpp */

‚Ä¶

/* End: code taken from ptrfunc.cpp */

What and where to submit (PLEASE READ, IMPORTANT) ‚Äì Same as before

Submissions guidelines are below. Some parts of the grading process might be automatic. Students are expected to strictly follow these guidelines in order to have a smooth grading process. If you do not follow these guidelines, depending on the severity of the problem created during the grading process, 5 or more penalty points are to be deducted from the grade.

Name your cpp file that contains your main program using the following convention:

‚ÄúSUCourseUserName_YourLastname_YourNames_HWnumber.cpp‚Äù

Your SUCourse user name is your SUNet user name which is used for checking sabanciuniv e-mails (not the numeric one). Do NOT use any spaces, non-ASCII and Turkish characters in the file name. For example, if your SUCourse user name is cago, name is √áaƒülayan, and last name is √ñzbugsƒ±zkodyazaroƒülu, then the file name must be:

Cago_Ozbugsizkodyazaroglu_Caglayan_hw2.cpp

Actually, it does not matter whether you use uppercase of lowercase letters in the file names.

Cago_Ozbugsizkodyazaroglu_Caglayan_hw2_myfuncs.cpp or

You will receive zero if your compressed zip file does not expand or it does not contain the correct files. The naming convention of the zip file is the same. The name of the zip file should be as follows:

SUCourseUserName_YourLastname_YourNames_HWnumber.zip

For example, zubzipler_Zipleroglu_Zubeyir_hw2.zip is a valid name, but

Hw2_hoz_HasanOz.zip, HasanOzHoz.zip

are NOT valid names.

Submit via SUCourse ONLY! You will receive no credits if you submit by other means (e-mail, paper, etc.).

Successful submission is one of the requirements of the homework. If, for some reason, you cannot successfully submit your homework and we cannot grade it, your grade will be 0.

Good Luck!
